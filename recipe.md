 1 tbsp oil

 2 red onions chopped into half moons

 2 cloves garlic chopped

 200 g beetroot grated finely

 200 g carrots grated finely

 200 g oyster mushrooms chopped

 3 tbsp tamari

 pinch of salt

 pinch of black pepper

 200 g cashews chopped

 5 g sage chopped

 5 g thyme leaves

 75 g dry couscous

 1 sheet of puff pastry

 oil to brush

Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius

Cook couscous according to pack instructions.

Add 1 tbsp oil to a pan on a high heat

Once heated, add the onion and garlic. Fry for about 2 minutes or until golden

Add in the mushrooms and fry for about 1 minute before adding tamari

Mix through the tamari and fry for 1 minute

Once the tamari has absorbed add the grated beetroot and carrot, along with the salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, adding a few tablespoons of water if needed, stirring occasionally.

Next add the cashew and continue to mix through until everything starts to stick to the bottom of the pan

Take the pan off the heat and add the sage and thyme along with the couscous and mix all together, allow to cool before adding to the pastry.

Take 1 sheet of puff pastry and add your mixture along the centre of the sheet in a cylindrical shape

Wrap the filling tightly with the pastry and flip over, so the seam side is down on the parchment paper.

Mark/score the top of the pastry as you'd like, using the back of a sharp knife so you do not cut through the pastry and brush with oil.

Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through, slice and enjoy!
